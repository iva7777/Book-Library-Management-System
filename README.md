## Backend Architecture üóÑÔ∏è

The backend is designed using **Spring Boot**, following a **layered architecture** to handle the core features of the Library Management System, including user authentication, book management, and search functionalities. Below is a breakdown of the key modules and folders that make up the backend architecture:

### Folder Structure Overview üóÉÔ∏è

1. **Common**
   - **Subfolder: Response**
     - `ApiResponse<T>`: A generic class to parse JSON responses.
   - **Subfolder: Util**
     - `ResponseHelper`: Provides utility methods for generating common API responses:
       - `generateResponse()`: Standardizes API responses.
       - `successResponse()`: Handles successful responses.
       - `failureResponse()`: Manages failure responses.
       - `notFoundResponse()`: Handles 404 not found responses.
   - **BookStatusDeserializer**: Helps parse the `BookStatus` enum value to a JSON object for easier fetching.

2. **Config**
   - **OpenAPIConfig**: Configures **Swagger UI** with JWT token authorization for API documentation and testing.

3. **Controller**
   - This folder contains all the RESTful endpoints for various resources:
     - `AppUserController`
     - `AuthorController`
     - `BookController`
     - `ReaderCardController`
     - `ReaderController`

4. **DTO (Data Transfer Objects)**
   - Stores all DTOs used to send and receive data from the database. DTOs are used to decouple entity representation from request/response data structures.

5. **Exception**
   - Contains global and custom exceptions for better error handling:
     - `GlobalExceptionHandler`: Handles all uncaught exceptions.
     - Custom exceptions include:
       - `BookNotAvailableException`
       - `NameAlreadyTakenException`
       - `NotFoundException`

6. **Mapper**
   - Holds the mappers that convert entities to DTOs and vice versa for clean and efficient data transformation.

7. **Model**
   - Contains all the entities (JPA models) used in the system:
     - `AppUser`, `Book`, `Author`, `Reader`, `ReaderCard`
     - **Enums**: 
       - `Role`: Enum for user roles (e.g., librarian, reader).
       - `BookStatus`: Enum representing the various states a book can have (available, borrowed, discarded.).

8. **Repository**
   - Contains all `JPARepositories` that interface with the database for CRUD operations on the entities.

9. **Search**
   - Contains request records used in search functionalities within services and controllers:
     - `BookSearchRequest`
     - `ReaderSearchRequest`

10. **Service**
    - **Subfolder Interface**: Defines the abstraction layer for service methods (CRUD and search).
    - **Implementation**: Contains the concrete implementations for the service interfaces, handling core logic for operations and searches.

11. **Security**
    - **Config**: 
      - `AppConfig`: Defines beans for `AuthenticationManager`, `AuthenticationProvider`, `PasswordEncoder`, and a custom `UserDetailsService`.
      - `JwtAuthFilter`: A filter that handles JWT-based authentication and authorization.
      - `JwtService`: Provides methods to generate tokens, validate tokens, and extract claims.
      - `SecurityConfig`: Defines security policies, including which endpoints require authentication and what mechanisms are used.
    - **AuthenticationController**: Provides endpoints for user authentication (`login`, `register`, `logout`) using JWT.
    - **AuthenticationService**: Implements the business logic for user authentication and token management.
    - **Custom UserDetailsService**: A custom implementation of `UserDetailsService` for loading user data based on username.

### Security Architecture üëÆ

- **JWT Authentication**: The backend uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. Key components include:
  - **JwtAuthFilter**: Intercepts HTTP requests and checks for JWT tokens in the Authorization header.
  - **JwtService**: Handles token generation, validation, expiration checks, and extraction of user information from the JWT.
  - **SecurityConfig**: Defines security policies, restricting access to specific endpoints based on user roles (e.g., `librarian`, `reader`).

### API Documentation üóé

- **Swagger UI**: Integrated with JWT token support via **OpenAPIConfig**, allowing authorized users to interact with and test the API.

---

## Frontend Architecture üéÄ

The frontend of this project is developed using **Angular** and styled with **DaisyUI** and **TailwindCSS**. The project is organized using a **core-features-shared** architecture, which allows for better separation of concerns and easier maintainability.

### Folder Structure Overview üóÉÔ∏è

1. **Core**
   - This folder contains the fundamental features of the application, such as:
     - **Authentication Service**: Manages user login, registration, and token handling.
     - **Guards**: Route guards that restrict access based on authentication and user roles.
     - **Login and Register Components**: Responsible for user authentication.
     - **Navigation & Footer Components**: The main layout components that are used throughout the app.
     - **Pagination Component**: Handles pagination functionality for tables and lists.
     - **Token Interceptor**: Intercepts HTTP requests to include JWT tokens in the headers.
     - **Models**: Angular models that mirror the backend models (e.g., `AppUser`, `Book`, `Author`, `Reader`, `ReaderCard`).

2. **Features**
   - This folder contains the main components responsible for the app's key functionalities:
     - **Users, Authors, Books, Readers and ReaderCards Components**: Responsible for CRUD operations and search functionalities.
     - **Services**: Each feature has its respective service that handles API communication for data retrieval and manipulation.
     - **Search Models**: Custom models for handling unified searches in the app (e.g., searching for books or readers).

3. **Homepage**
   - A static page independent of the backend, used for introductory or landing purposes.

4. **Shared**
   - This folder contains components and utilities that are used throughout the application:
     - **Loading Animation**: A service and interceptor to show a loading spinner during API requests.
     - **Wrong Credentials Modal**: Displays a modal when incorrect login information is provided.
     - **Error Pages**: Custom components for handling errors such as `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, and `500 Internal Server Error`.
     - **Custom Pipes**: Pipes for formatting data, such as date formats or text transformations, in the UI.

5. **AppComponent**
   - The root component of the Angular application, responsible for initializing and setting up global features.

6. **Config**
   - Contains configurations for HTTP communication, including:
     - **HttpClient**: Used to handle all HTTP requests and responses in the application.
     - **Interceptors**: Manages token injection and error handling during HTTP requests.
     - **Routers**: Defines routing for navigation within the app.

7. **Routes**
   - Contains all the paths for the application‚Äôs navigation. Each feature or component has its own route for easier navigation and component access.

8. **TailwindCSS Configuration**
   - **tailwind.config.js**: Configuration for **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI**, ensuring consistent and responsive styling throughout the app. Customizations for DaisyUI components are made here to enhance the look and feel of the application.
